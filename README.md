# Graph Centrality Metrics

This project involves the implementation of Betweenness and Closeness centrality metrics and ranking nodes in two graph datasets: Zachary Karate Club Network and Facebook Social Network.

## Centrality Metrics

### Betweenness Centrality

Betweenness centrality identifies the strategic location of a node in a graph. The formula for betweenness centrality (C_B) is given by:

### Closeness Centrality

Closeness centrality measures how close a node is to other nodes in the graph. The formula for closeness centrality (C_C) is given by:
